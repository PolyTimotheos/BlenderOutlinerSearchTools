Adds a select button next to the search bar that selects the search results and a filter drop down to limit the types of objects to select.

Selection Modes:

Select Button = select all objects that match the search and filter criteria

Select Button + Ctrl = select only visible

Select Button + Shift = add to current selection

Select Button + Alt = remove from current selection

In the Filter dropdown holding Shift and clicking one of the Button will activate it and deactivate all the others.

It's only tested on Blender 4.52 so far.

That's it! Hope you find it useful :)
